4(a) Simulate three nodes point-to-point networks with a duplex link between
them. Set the queue size and vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets
dropped.

4(b)  Simulate a transmission of ping message over a network topology consisting
of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.

4(c)  Simulate an Ethernet LAN with TCL script and simulate using ns2.

4(d) Simulate simple ESS with transmitting nodes in wireless LAN by simulation
and determine the performance w.r.t transmission of packets

4(e) Implement and study the performance of GSM on NS2 (Using MAC layer)
or equivalent environment.
